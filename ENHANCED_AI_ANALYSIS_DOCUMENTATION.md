### 5. **AI Model Integration**

#### **Multiple AI Inference Strategy**
The system now makes multiple AI calls for specialized analysis:
1. **Overview Generation**: Broad progress summary
2. **Start Analysis**: Baseline condition assessment  
3. **End Analysis**: Current status evaluation
4. **Recommendations**: Future planning suggestions
5. **Main Summary**: Comprehensive report synthesis

#### **Smart Prompt Engineering**
- Context-aware prompt generation
- Therapy-specific language and terminology
- Student-centered analysis focus
- Goal-oriented recommendation system

### 6. **Progress Analysis Features**

#### **Improvement Trend Analysis**
```python
def _analyze_improvement_trend(start_levels, end_levels):
    # Quantifies progress from start to current state
    # Maps progress levels to numerical scores
    # Calculates improvement trajectory
    # Provides trend classification
```

#### **Consistency Scoring**
- Session attendance regularity analysis
- Therapy schedule adherence tracking
- Progress consistency evaluation
- Engagement level assessment

#### **Session Frequency Analysis**  
- Average time between therapy sessions
- Optimal scheduling recommendations
- Attendance pattern identification
- Treatment intensity evaluation
