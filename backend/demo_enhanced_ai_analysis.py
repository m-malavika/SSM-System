At the beginning of therapy in January 2024, {student_name} presented with multiple challenges:

Speech Therapy Baseline:
- Significant articulation difficulties, especially with 'th', 'r', and 's' sounds
- Very shy and reluctant to participate in verbal activities
- Limited vocabulary usage and poor sentence formation
- Required constant encouragement to engage

Occupational Therapy Baseline:
- Poor fine motor skills and difficulty with precise movements
- Improper pencil grip requiring constant correction
- Hand-eye coordination below age expectations
- Struggled with basic cutting and writing activities

Overall, the student required substantial support across both therapy domains.

- Natural conversation flow and excellent peer interactions
- Successfully leads classroom presentations and group discussions
- Demonstrates advanced communication skills appropriate for mainstream classroom

Occupational Therapy Current Status:
- Fine motor skills now at or above age-appropriate levels
- Independent completion of complex cutting and writing tasks
- Consistent proper pencil grip throughout extended activities
- Shows creativity and pride in completed projects

The student now requires minimal to no therapeutic support and has exceeded initial treatment goals.

Based on {student_name}'s exceptional progress, the following recommendations are suggested:

Short-term (Next 4 weeks):
- Transition to mainstream classroom activities without therapeutic support
- Monitor progress through teacher observations rather than direct therapy
- Provide periodic check-ins to ensure skill maintenance

Long-term (Next 3 months):
- Consider advanced communication skills training if desired
- Explore leadership opportunities to utilize improved confidence
- Maintain current skill level through regular classroom participation

Discharge Planning:
- Student is ready for therapy discharge with excellent prognosis
- Recommend follow-up assessment in 6 months to ensure skill retention
- Family education completed - parents equipped to support continued progress
